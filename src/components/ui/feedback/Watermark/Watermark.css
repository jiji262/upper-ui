/* src/components/ui/feedback/Watermark/Watermark.css */
/* Based on antd/es/watermark/style/index.css */

.ant-watermark-wrapper {
  position: relative; /* Required for the absolute positioned watermark overlay */
  /* overflow: hidden; /* Ensures watermark doesn't spill if children have specific overflow */
  /* This might be needed depending on how children are styled */
}

/* The .ant-watermark-bg class is applied to the dynamically created div by JS */
/* Its styles (backgroundImage, backgroundRepeat, zIndex, etc.) are set inline in Watermark.tsx */
/* This CSS file is mostly for the wrapper or any non-dynamic parts if needed. */

/* Example for potential global styling if not all handled by inline styles: */
/*
.ant-watermark-bg {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-repeat: repeat;
  pointer-events: none; // Ensure watermark doesn't interfere with content interaction
  z-index: 9; // Default z-index, can be overridden by prop
}
*/

/* If there were specific styles for the content being watermarked, they could go here, */
/* but usually, the content is just the children passed to the Watermark component. */
/* For instance, if Watermark had a specific content div: */
/*
.ant-watermark-content {
  position: relative; // Ensure content is not covered by watermark if z-index is mismanaged
  z-index: 1; // Content above watermark background if structure was different
}
*/

/* Current implementation in Watermark.tsx dynamically creates a div with class 'ant-watermark-bg'
   and applies all necessary styles inline for the watermark layer.
   The .ant-watermark-wrapper is the main container passed `children`.
   Therefore, this CSS file might be minimal unless specific wrapper styles are needed
   that are not covered by the inline style prop on the wrapper.
